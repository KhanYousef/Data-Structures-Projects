# Data Structures Projects


## Projects

**Trip Planner** - A user may plan a trip and create stops on their itinerary with this. The nodes act as stops on the trip and the project is implemented using the linked list data structure. Users can make multiple itineraries and have a cursor to track which nodestop they are at.

**JavaScriptFormatter** - The user can allow the program to read code from a text/notepad file and the program will format  it to be neat with indents and other proper formatting with the use of the stack data structure.

**Download Queue**- Allows a user to simulate a download speed queue where the user chooses the probability of regular and premium download tasks. Premium ones are given priority using the queue data structure and the program will give a summary at the end of all the download speeds and tasks completed.

**Decision Tree** - Creates a binary tree and finds a specific leaf based on information provided by the user leading up to traits held by that leaf.

**Room Lookup** - User can create a campus within which buildings and classrooms can be created with however many number of seats and optional whiteboards and AV equipment as well. The user can then, through use of the hashmap structure, search through the rooms and buildings and find specific rooms or places that have certain equipment/chalkboards, etc.

**Movie Database**:  Using the comparator interface and an externally downloaded movie database which the program reads from, this project organizes and sorts a movie database and can also create a personal list of films with number of occurrences of a certain actor in the list of movies. It can sort by year and name as well. The user can also search for all movies with a certain actor in it.
